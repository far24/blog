Hi, my name is Fahim Ahmed and I am a Ph.D. candidate studying Civil Engineering (Dissertation on Transportation Engr.) at University of South Carolina.

I am interested in the topic of freight system performance, vehicle routing, and traffic safety. Currently, I am working with Dr. Nathan Huynh to develop a solution for truck (re-)routing under disruptive environment in a distribution network.
